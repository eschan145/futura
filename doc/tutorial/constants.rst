Constants
=========

Futura provides dozens of constants that are used for effects across all widgets.

Global constants
----------------

There are a few global constants that are very commonly used. There are several sides, like ``LEFT``, ``CENTER``, and ``RIGHT``, which equal the lowercase value.  Then are callbacks, which are ``SINGLE``, ``DOUBLE``, and ``MULTIPLE``, which equal 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

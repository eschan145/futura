Futura user interface toolkit
=============================

Futura is a user interface toolkit for the Python
```arcade``<https://arcade.academy/>_ library. It offers an object-oriented
approach to creating highly versatile and modern user interfaces for games or
solely UI applications. Futura is very easy to use and exploits the advantages
of object-oriented programming.

Several widgets are provided in this module. These include
:py:class:`~futura.widgets.Label`, :py:class:`~futura.widgets.Button`,
:py:class:`~futura.widgets.Entry`, :py:class:`~futura.widgets.Toggle`,
and :py:class:`~futura.widgets.Slider`. Futura provides API to create your own 
custom widgets. You can base your widget to have components of previously
defined widgets, or create your own solely from scratch. 

There are a few differences from arcade's provided user interface system. First
of all, the built-in widgets come with more features. It is faster and can use
fewer lines of code. Also, it is easier to use. You don't have to learn a lot
of complicated layouts and geometry managers.

Lastly, image support. Futura uses images for all of its widgets. This might
seem like you can't customize the size or stuff like that, but border resizing
algorithms are used to adjust width and height of an image in pixels.

The look and feel of a widget can be adjusted programmatically, but themes can
be used. A theme pack comes with sounds, images for all widgets, additional
images for icons, and the theme configuration file. It is quite easy to create
your own theme pack. Refer to the theming guide on how to create and manage
themes.
